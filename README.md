## How It Works

1. The software initializes by including the necessary libraries and defining input parameters such as preferred timeframes, lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.
2. The trade module is initialized using the CTrade class.
3. The code includes a function `isBreakerBlocksMet()` that needs to be implemented by the user. This function should contain the Breaker Blocks logic and return true if the conditions are met, otherwise false.
4. The `executeTrade()` function is responsible for executing trades. It checks if trading is allowed and if the Breaker Blocks condition is met. If both conditions are satisfied, it opens a trade using the `trade.Buy()` function.
5. The `OnInit()` function sets the required timeframes for analysis.
6. The `OnNewBar()` function is called whenever a new bar is formed in the highest timeframe. It executes the `executeTrade()` function if necessary.
7. The `OnTick()` function is called whenever a new tick is received. It also executes the `executeTrade()` function if necessary.
8. The `OnDeinit()` function handles the deinitialization logic. Users can add their own deinitialization code here.
9. The code includes additional functions to start or stop trading, check the current trade status, get the last trade execution time, get the version of the software, provide technical support, deliver the final code, test the code, and handle additional requirements or modifications.
10. The main execution flow is handled by the `OnStart()` function. Users can add their own logic here.

Please note that this code serves as a template and requires the implementation of the Breaker Blocks logic in the `isBreakerBlocksMet()` function. Traders should customize this function based on their trading strategy and market analysis.
